Scene 1


The game starts by pressing the green Scratch button and the appearance of seeds in a field of sunflowers to the sound of opening music. In the scene there are point and volume counts. The seeds float and when the music ends the child blows as loud as they can into the microphone to activate the seeds and get them to move to travel. The volume is measured in the variable "volume". The child in the scene is the hero - a cloud that changes shape when he blows. When the child decides by pressing the space bar, he is transported to the second scene.

Scene 2

 
The second scene shows the cloud blowing and the seeds travelling. The harder the child blows, the more the seeds move. When the child decides, pressing the space bar takes the child to the third scene.


Scene 3

 

In the third scene the cloud and the seeds appear. With the help of the camera and by putting the child's hand in front of the camera, the floating seeds are transformed into seeds that fall to the earth and are planted in the soil. When the child decides, pressing the space bar takes him/her to the fourth scene

Scene 4
 
In the fourth scene, the sunflowers that have bloomed, a hand and sunflowers that fall from above are shown and the child must use the right and left arrow 
keys to pick as many sunflowers as he can with his hand. The sunflowers are counted as points and are displayed at the top right of the stage. When the child decides to stop the game by pressing the Scratch stop button. 
Each player counts and records their points.
The game can also be accompanied by story telling.
